# Neural Networks From Scratch (Work In Progress)

## Description

In this project, we will try to implement the major building blocks of neural networks from scratch.  
We will do this through multiple steps:

1. Build a logistic regression classifier as a neural network
2. Build a neural network with a single hidden layer
3. Build a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers
4. Build a convolutional neural network
5. Build a recurrent neural network

## Libraries

We will be using mainly Python and NumPy to implement the model, in addition to some other helper libraries for an easy manipulation of files and datasets. Run the following command for installing the required libraries:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Acknowledgments
