# Logistic Regression Using Neural Networks

## Description

Given a train set and a test set of cats and non-cats images, we will try to build a logistic regression model to classify these images.  
The challenge here is to implement the model from scratch using a neural networks approach.

## Libraries

We will be using mainly Python and NumPy to implement the model, in addition to some other helper libraries for an easy manipulation of images. Run the following command for installing the required libraries:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
